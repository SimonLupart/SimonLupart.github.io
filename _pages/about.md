I am a first year PhD Candidate in Information Retrieval within the IRLab from the University of Amsterdam (UvA). After I graduated from my engineering school ENSIMAG, I started research in NLP/IR at Naver Labs Europe for two years, within the Search and Recommendation team. I then decided to join UvA to engage in a PhD and devote myself in full research. Supervisors: Prof. dr. [Evangelos Kanoulas](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/e.kanoulas/) and dr. [Mohammad Aliannejadi](https://aliannejadi.com/).

Interested in information retrieval (IR), with a particular focus on 
- conversational search,
- distributions shifts,
- adversarial training, 
- large language models (LLMs).
